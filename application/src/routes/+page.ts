 This code will be run when the user first requests the base directory of the website (ex: "www.narrative.com/")

 Here, we will eventually want to perform some checks to determine where to route the user.

 For example, if the user is new, we want to ensure they are being directed to the introduction/onboarding

 We also might want to make this the entry point to a login system.

 For now, we will create a fake response and direct the user to the introduction sequence.
